# blackjack_godot
This is just for me to practice game dev. Also this project will be my first time using Godot

* Godot version 4.0.2 stable

if using a different version of Godot please note below

If using an earlier or later version of Godot the imported models/textures might go buggy., but the good thing is the code/system itself will be fine.
Experienced this first hand when testing some things, started on Godot version 4.2.2 stable and switched to 4.0.2 and the models/textures went all over the place and filled the screen.
- To fix it I had to delete the models/texture and re upload them again
